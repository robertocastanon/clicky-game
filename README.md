# clicky-game

Clicky-game is a memory game built fully with [React!](https://reactjs.org/)

The goal of the game is to try not click on a card you haven't clicked already and try to reach the max score of 12.

Clicking on a duplicate will result in the game resetting.

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) to break up the application's UI into seperate components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

Live version of the site can be accessed [here](https://robertocastanon.github.io/clicky-game/).
